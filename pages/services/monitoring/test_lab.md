## Setup

### Android

1. **Add Firebase to Your Android Project:**
   Follow the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) to add Firebase to your Android project.

2. **Write Automated Tests:**
   Use Espresso for UI testing in your Android app.

   {{group:code}}

   ```java [MainActivityTest.java]
   import androidx.test.ext.junit.rules.ActivityScenarioRule;
   import androidx.test.ext.junit.runners.AndroidJUnit4;
   import androidx.test.espresso.Espresso;
   import androidx.test.espresso.matcher.ViewMatchers;

   import org.junit.Rule;
   import org.junit.Test;
   import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

   @RunWith(AndroidJUnit4.class)
   public class MainActivityTest {
       @Rule
       public ActivityScenarioRule<MainActivity> activityScenarioRule =
               new ActivityScenarioRule<>(MainActivity.class);

       @Test
       public void testButtonClick() {
           // Simulate button click and check result
           Espresso.onView(ViewMatchers.withId(R.id.button)).perform(click());
           Espresso.onView(ViewMatchers.withId(R.id.textView))
                   .check(matches(withText("Button clicked")));
       }
   }
   ```

   import XCTest

   class MainActivityTest: XCTestCase {
       override func setUpWithError() throws {
           continueAfterFailure = false
           XCUIApplication().launch()
       }

       func testButtonClick() throws {
           let app = XCUIApplication()
           app.buttons["button"].tap()
           XCTAssertTrue(app.staticTexts["Button clicked"].exists)
       }
   }
   ```
