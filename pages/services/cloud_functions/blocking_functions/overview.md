## Overview of Firebase Blocking Functions

### Introduction
Firebase Blocking Functions, also known as "blocking extensions" or "blocking hooks," provide a powerful way to intercept and modify events during specific points in a user’s authentication lifecycle. With Cloud Functions for Firebase v2, these functions allow developers to enhance security and control over authentication processes by performing checks and modifications before user creation or sign-in. This overview will explore the concept of blocking functions, their use cases, and provide brief descriptions of each type of blocking function available.

### What are Blocking Functions?
Blocking functions are cloud functions that trigger before certain authentication events occur. By leveraging these functions, you can add custom logic to the authentication process, ensuring that your application's security and data integrity requirements are met. These functions are particularly useful for enforcing custom validation rules, modifying user data, and implementing additional security checks.

### Key Use Cases
1. **Custom Validation:** Enforce specific validation rules for user data during creation or sign-in.
2. **User Data Modification:** Modify user data before it is written to Firebase Authentication.
3. **Security Enhancements:** Implement additional security checks, such as verifying email domains or user statuses.
4. **Role Management:** Assign custom claims to users for role-based access control.
5. **User Restrictions:** Block user creation or sign-in based on custom criteria, such as email domains or account status.

### Types of Blocking Functions
Firebase provides two main types of blocking functions:

1. **Before Create Blocking Function**
   - **Description:** Triggered before a new user is created. Allows you to perform checks and modifications on the user’s data before it is written to Firebase Authentication.
   - **Use Cases:**
     - Enforcing custom validation rules on user data.
     - Modifying user data before creation.
     - Blocking user creation based on custom criteria.

2. **Before Sign-In Blocking Function**
   - **Description:** Triggered before a user signs in. Allows you to perform checks and modifications on the user’s data before the sign-in process is completed.
   - **Use Cases:**
     - Enforcing additional security checks.
     - Modifying user claims or tokens before sign-in.
     - Blocking sign-in based on custom criteria.

### Summary
Blocking functions are a crucial tool for managing and securing your Firebase Authentication process. By using these functions, you can ensure that only valid and authorized users can create accounts and sign in to your application. The detailed guides linked above provide specific examples and use cases for each type of blocking function, helping you implement these features effectively in your Firebase project.
